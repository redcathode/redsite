### Hey there!  
If you're reading this, chances are I've sent or given you a link to this webpage around when I started taking your class. I don't need much done on your part - this document briefs over an illness I have primarily to explain what it entails and contextualize some things you might see in class.  
  
### In short:  

- I have a bipolar spectrum disorder.  

- Bipolar, contrary to popular belief, does _not_ involve emotional dysregulation or short-term mood swings.  

- The main characteristic of the disorder is long-term shifts in baseline mood, energy, and motivation. The period, inclination, and intensity of these varies widely from person to person.

- For me, most time is spent in a more depressive state, and I cycle on a period of around 1 to 3 weeks. Some traits can cycle independently over a period of months, though.  

- Practically speaking, I tend to work on and turn in assignments in "blocks" of several days every week or so. If I haven't already, I may ask to record lectures whenever I'm not able to pay attention to the degree I feel I'd need to. I can _occasionally_ push through this if need be - I don't need you to reschedule projects or tests.  

- I do have manic episodes, but they're very mild and don't require hospitalization or special treatment. (If you're interested, this puts me under type II by the DSM-V classification.) These are sometimes noticeable by an outside observer (fidgeting, faster speech and movement, general extraversion) but are generally very benign - if anything, they're when I'm the most productive and are often how I come up with new projects and research topics.  


Don't worry if I seem out of it from time to time! I've been living with this illness for a while now and don't require help in managing it. I'm always open to chat, though.
