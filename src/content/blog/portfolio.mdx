# Portfolio

## Programming

I run Linux on almost every device I own, and am pretty familiar with sysadmin work - my usual stack is (Alpine or Fedora) + Docker Compose. I also have some experience with NixOS and with Debian and Arch-based distros.

For embedded, I usually use PlatformIO or ESP-IDF - here's two respective examples:
- https://github.com/redcathode/led-wall/blob/main/src/main.cpp
- https://github.com/redcathode/blights_esp32_server/blob/main/main/esp_rest_main.c

[This website](https://github.com/redcathode/redsite) was built with [Astro](https://astro.build), which, among other things, lets me have Markdown, JSX, and an [RSS feed](https://redcatho.de/blog/rss.xml), while still serving my website as static files - pretty neat!

## Electronics
I generally don't design PCBs for one-off projects, but I sometimes need to fit parts into a very small form factor or break out an SMD-only part. Here's one such example of both, a small ATTiny1614 board I designed in KiCad for a handheld epaper watch in 2022:

<Picture src={attiny3} class="blogimage" quality="mid" formats={['avif', 'webp']} alt="todo"/>
</div>

Also from 2022: this funky-looking 200wh (!) USB-C power bank, consisting of a custom-made enclosure housing a stack of 16 [EVE 33Vs](https://web.archive.org/web/20221111144707/https://bulkbattery.com/products/copy-of-eve-25p-18650-2500mah-20a-battery). I also ended up cobbling together a spot welder from some supercapacitors and MOSFETs I had lying around, but that has unfortunately since been repurposed into other projects.

A 900-watt water-cooled LED array (successor to [this 100w one](/blog/blights), mounted onto a bamboo scaffold. This was something of a rush job - for lack of an inexpensive solution that met my absurd power requirements, I made a bespoke PSU by strapping a stepper motor to a variac and then running it through a bridge rectifier.
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 1rem;">
<Picture src={ledarraymodule} class="blogimage" quality="mid" formats={['avif', 'webp']} alt="todo"/>
<Picture src={ledarraypsu} class="blogimage" quality="mid" formats={['avif', 'webp']} alt="todo"/>
</div>
<br />
<Picture src={overheadview} class="blogimage" quality="mid" formats={['avif', 'webp']} alt="todo"/>

I have since recognized that this was a bit of a fire hazard; were I to do it again, I'd use an SMPS from the get-go, machine all-metal water cooling mounts, and, most importantly, build a proper metal enclosure rather than using bamboo I harvested from our neighbor's backyard.

I helped set up, manage, and maintain my school's 3D printing lab - speaking of which, here's a modified first-gen Ender 3 running at ~5x stock speed:

## Misc
I started getting interested in forecasting a bit before I finished high school. I made [a Kalshi account](https://kalshi.com/ideas/profiles/youngneil) a few months ago, primarily betting on tech advancements.
