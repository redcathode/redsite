## Programming



## Electronics
I generally don't design PCBs for one-off projects, but I sometimes need to fit parts into a very small form factor or break out an SMD-only part. Here's one such example of both, a small ATTiny1614 board I designed in KiCad for a handheld epaper watch in 2022:

</div>

Also from 2022: this funky-looking 200wh (!) USB-C power bank, consisting of a custom-made enclosure housing a stack of 16 [EVE 33Vs](https://web.archive.org/web/20221111144707/https://bulkbattery.com/products/copy-of-eve-25p-18650-2500mah-20a-battery). I also ended up cobbling together a spot welder from some supercapacitors and MOSFETs I had lying around, but that has unfortunately since been repurposed into other projects.

From late last year: a 900-watt water-cooled LED array, mounted onto a bamboo scaffold. This was something of a rush job - for lack of an inexpensive solution that met my absurd power requirements, I made a bespoke PSU by strapping a stepper motor to a variac and then running it through a bridge rectifier. I have since recognized that this was a bit of a fire hazard.

## Misc
I started getting interested in forecasting a bit before I finished high school. I made [a Kalshi account](https://kalshi.com/ideas/profiles/youngneil) a few months ago, primarily betting on tech advancements.
